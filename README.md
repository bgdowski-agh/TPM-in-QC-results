# TPM-in-QC-results
Results of tests covered in "Security Analysis of Tree Parity Machines Synchronization Process for Error Correction in Quantum Key Distribution" article + tests with different parameters

The results are split into folders - one per scenario presented in the article. The numerical data is presented in text files, as well as on charts.
Filenames contain:
* K value
* N value (or two values, in case of scenario 3)
* L value
* QBER value in %
* update algorithm name
There are two types of charts:
- charts that present victim's and attacker's synchronization percen per update (called "synch")
- charts that present attacker's synchonization with victims' keys, as well as number of updates performed by attacker (called "update")
